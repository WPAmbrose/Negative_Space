# Story
The year is 2090. Humanity has been invaded by cyborg aliens. The war turns sour, but then we discover how to reverse-engineer their technology. Using it throws human perception into reverse- black becomes white, inside becomes outside, and the cold colorless technology of the aliens appears to teem with life and a more vibrant color than any other. Your mission is to use a hybrid of human and alien technology to strike down the invaders for as long as you can.

Be careful, as only three strikes from alien attackers can render your ship inoperable, and the reverse-engineered technology can only be repaired three times before disintegrating.

Be sure to note as well that thanks to the alien technology your ship can change between three forms- a small but deadly one, a larger one with twice the firepower, and an even larger one with an attack that cannot be stopped. Make use of these forms to dodge incoming fire and dish out your own attacks.

Your ship-mounted weapons have a limited firing rate, but due to resonance with alien materials you can fire again as soon as you hit your target, except while in your largest form.
